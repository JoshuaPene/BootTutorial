      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>Bootstrap is “the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.” Bootstrap optimizes code for mobile
            devices first and scales up web components through CSS. By offering pre-set classes, you can cut out a ton of CSS styling! Bootstrap
            has made a ton of preset-classes and their website is full of information on how to implement their code. While you can definitely check it out,
            I am going to teach you how to create a simple website that implements Bootstrap’s column layouts with some fun css layouts
            (don’t worry, it’s super easy to learn how to use)!

        <div class="content-text">
          <p>Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you’ll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn’t cause any considerable hiccups.</p><br></br>

            The first part of using Bootstrap, is to get it linked in your code! While bootstrap can be downloaded on your computer and used in projects,
            I am going to link bootstrap into the &lt;link> in the &lt;head> before any other stylesheets. Bootstrap offers this code on their website,
            which I highly recommend checking out, but I will provide the code I used to link this:<br></br>

      <h1>Bootstrap Explained</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
          Now that you have bootstrap, I will talk briefly about what it is and how you can use it! Basically, Bootstrap offers pre-made classes that you
          have just linked to your code. From this, all you need to do is figure out what classes you want to add (classes can be stacked easily)! It is very simple
          and the possibilities are many, but it can seem overwhelming to start. I will be going over how to recreate my website with the classes I decided to implement in my code.

    <div class="container content">
      <h1>Navigation</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
            First off, I am going to go over some of Bootstrap’s Navigation classes.  (First you will need to create a header and nav class.)
            Bootstrap classes all have specific names that will perform their specific styles. In the Nav class that is set up, I have implemented
            many specific classes which I will show down below. First off, I will declare that the nav class is a “navbar”. This will let bootstrap apply
            some base code  to the navbar that I want set up. Next I will show many different classes and what each one does!
          </p><br></br>
          <p>Adding any of these styles to the class will change the styling of the navigation bar. Feel free to try a bunch of these
            and figure out what each one does and how each one can work with each other!</p>
            <ul class="options">
              <li>
                <h5>fixed-top:</h5>
                <p>This will do exactly what it says! It will make the Nav-bar stick to the top of the screen (the navbar on this website is an example of this).</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>navbar-expand-sm (or xs, md, lg, xl):</h5>
                <p>This will make sure that the navigation bar will expand due to the size of the screen that is being used.
                  These are called responsive breakpoints. They will create breakpoints for the layouts and interfaces depending on the viewports scale. If you scale this website, you will see how the
                navbar reacts to the size restraints.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>navbar-dark (navbar-light, etc.):</h5>
                <p>This will change the color and style that you are using for the bar.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>bg-dark (bg-light): </h5>
                <p>This will change the background color used for the nav bar.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>justify-content-between: </h5>
                <p>You can also add stylings like "justify content" among other things!</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>collapse navbar-collapse:</h5>
                <p>A component which wraps the remain components of the navbar such as links to other pages on the websites.  </p>
              </li>
            </ul>

      <h1>Href Classes</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
            Now, one of the most exciting parts of Bootstrap is its ability to implement grid structures for you! Bootstrap uses containers,
             rows, and columns to layout and align content by using flexbox. In order to apply these grids, you have to put all of your elements into a div
             class named “container”. This is the first step for getting grids into your code. Bootstrap uses a 12-column,
             flexbox grid system to help the user implement tons of their classes.
          </p>
            <ul class="options">
              <li>
                <h5>container</h5>
                <p>Will create a simple grid structure for you to begin working with through a column. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>container-fluid</h5>
                <p>WIll have a container span the width of the viewport.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>row</h5>
                <p>Rows are wrappers for columns.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>column </h5>
                <p>column classes indicate the number of columns you would like to have in a row out of a
                  possible 12 per row. You will put column classes inside of row classes to make however
                  many columns span the row. A column class will be typed as “col”.</p>
                  <p>Bootstrap will automatically default the column settings to be equal-width. That will make your content in a row be spaced evenly.</p>
                  <p>In order to define how many columns you want to stretch out over a certain class, you will add a number to the end of a col. (Ex. “col-4”).</p>
                  <p>You have to make sure the numbers that you use throughout a row’s columns are equal to 12!</p>
                  <p>You can also add a “-auto” to the end of a col to make the spacing even out for you so you don’t have to worry about how it looks at certain viewports as much.</p>
                  <br></br>
                  <h5>Example and code:</h5>
                  This is an example of what these classes can do together and the code which made them.

      <h1>Alignment</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
            There are many familiar ways that you can align your rows just by adding Bootstrap’s premade classes.
            Many examples of alignment are some that we have used before, so I will just give examples of many that could be utilized.
          </p>
            <ul class="options">
              <li>
                <h5>Examples</h5>
                <p>align-items-start, align-items-center, align-items-end, justify-content-start, justify-content-center, justify-content-end, justify-content-around, justify-content-between, align-self-start, align-self-center, align-self-end</p>
                <h5>Order</h5>
                <p> You can apply order to your columns by adding an order class to your code: order-1, order-2, etc. (up to 12)</p>

      <h1>Cards</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
            To present my grid content, I chose to apply a simple “card-deck” to my classes to display my information
            in a really neat way. Cards are flexible and extensible content containers. They are built with “as little
            markup and styles as possible” so you have a lot of room to implement your own customization. I will show
            some types of content types that Bootstrap offers:
          </p>
            <ul class="options">
              <li>
                <h5>card-body</h5>
                <p>The building block of a card. Basically just a body tag, but inside a card.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>card-title</h5>
                <p>A title inside your card. Likely applied to some kind of h4, h5, etc.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>card-subtitle</h5>
                <p>Subtitle under the main title.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>card-text</h5>
                <p>Applied to a p-class for your text to be affected.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>card-link</h5>
                <p>Used to be applied to a href. </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <h5>card-img-top</h5>
                <p> This places an image to the top of the card. With
                  .card-text, text can be added to the card. Text within
                  .card-text can also be styled with the standard HTML tags.</p>
              </li>

            Bootstrap offers some really cool button classes that are easily applied to your buttons. They offer some
            quick colors and styles that you can use, and they are also easily editable. Here are a few examples of classes:
            (replace the _____ with the style you want from the list below! I really liked and used “info” for my project)
          </p>
            <ul class="options">
              <li>
                <h5>btn btn-__________</h5>
                <h5>btn btn-outline-________</h5>
                <h5>Bg-____ (changes the background color of an element for example)</h5>
                <p>Bootstrap has some preset colors and styles with specefic names.
                  A few of the names are as follows: primary, secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, dark, link</p>
                  <a href="#" class="btn btn-outline-info">Learn now!</a>
                  <h6><p class="btn-text">&lt;a href="#" class="btn btn-outline-info">Learn now!&lt;/a></p></h6>
                  <a href="#" class="btn btn-secondary">Learn now!</a>
                  <h6><p class="btn-text">&lt;a href="#" class="btn btn-secondary">Learn now!&lt;/a></p></h6>

              </li>
            </ul>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="container content">
      <h1>Extras</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
            A few other class elements I have implemented in my code from bootstrap are as follows:
          </p>
            <ul class="options">
              <li>
                <h5>rounded</h5>
                <p>This will round the corners of whatever element it is applied to</p>
                <h5>float-left float-right</h5>
                <p>These options will float whatever you want</p>
                <h5>foot</h5>
                <p>Foot is a class that you add to the footer to get some basic layouts applied to your footer</p>
                <h5>foot-list</h5>
                <p>this is what you would apply to a list used in the footer</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
      </div>
    </div>


    <div class="container content">
      <p>
        There is so much more that bootstrap offers that makes a coder's life easier.
        I would really encourage anyone to look into using it in their code!
      </p>

    </div>


    <footer>
      <div class="foot bg-dark">
      <ul class="foot-list float-left" style="padding-top: 12px;">
        <li><a href="#">About us</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
        <div class="float-right" style="padding-right: 70px;"><p> 2021, no lefts unreserved.</p></div>
      </div>
    </footer>

  </body>
</html>
