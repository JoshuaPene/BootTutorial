      <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>Bootstrap is “the world’s most popular framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites.” Bootstrap optimizes code for mobile
            devices first and scales up web components through CSS. By offering pre-set classes, you can cut out a ton of CSS styling! Bootstrap
            has made a ton of preset-classes and their website is full of information on how to implement their code. While you can definitely check it out,
            I am going to teach you how to create a simple website that implements Bootstrap’s column layouts with some fun css layouts
            (don’t worry, it’s super easy to learn how to use!)

        <div class="content-text">
          <p>Bootstrap requires the use of the HTML5 doctype. Without it, you’ll see some funky incomplete styling, but including it shouldn’t cause any considerable hiccups.</p><br></br>

            The first part of using Bootstrap, is to get it linked in your code! While bootstrap can be downloaded on your computer and used in projects,
            I am going to link bootstrap into the &lt;link> in the &lt;head> before any other stylesheets. Bootstrap offers this code on their website,
            which I highly recommend checking out, but I will provide the code I used to link this:<br></br>

          Now that you have bootstrap, I will talk briefly about what it is and how you can use it! Basically, Bootstrap offers pre-made classes that you
          have just linked to your code. From this, all you need to do is figure out what classes you want to add (classes can be stacked easily)! It is very simple
          and the possibilities are many, but it can seem overwhelming to start. I will be going over how to recreate my website with the classes I decided to implement in my code.

      <h1>Navigation</h1>
        <div class="content-text">
          <p>
            First off, I am going to go over some of Bootstrap’s Navigation classes.  (First you will need to create a header and nav class.)
            Bootstrap classes all have specific names that will perform their specific styles. In the Nav class that is set up, I have implemented
            many specific classes which I will show down below. First off, I will declare that the nav class is a “navbar”. This will let bootstrap apply
            some base code  to the navbar that I want set up. Next I will show many different classes and what each one does!
